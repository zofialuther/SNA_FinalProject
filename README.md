# Project Repository

This repository contains the files and notebooks for a music analysis project based on Spotify data.

## Files Description

### `experiments.ipynb`

- **Description**: This Jupyter notebook contains all the relevant code for the project. It includes data processing, analysis, and visualization steps that are central to the project.

### `log_mini.csv`

- **Description**: This CSV file contains listening session information sourced from Spotify. It is part of the [Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge/dataset_files). The data provides insights into user listening behaviors and session details.

### `tf_mini.csv`

- **Description**: This file holds detailed track information. Each row corresponds to a different track or song, and includes various features such as energy, acousticness, bounciness, duration, and more. This data is crucial for analyzing the characteristics of the songs.

### `data_by_genres.csv`

- **Description**: Similar to `tf_mini.csv`, this file contains feature information. However, instead of being organized by individual songs, it is categorized by genres. This allows for genre-based analysis of music features like energy, acousticness, etc.
